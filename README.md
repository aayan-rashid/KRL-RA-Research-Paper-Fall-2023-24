Abstract— In today's digital world, protecting network
infrastructures from rapidly developing cyber threats is more
important than ever. This research paper focuses on
introducing Artificial Intelligence-based approaches to
optimize network security. It discusses how AI can enhance
intrusion detection capabilities, traffic engineering policies,
and resource allocation strategies. Our vision is to build an
innovative and effective network security architecture based
on AI features that can predict attacks and enhance network
performance through better resource management at high
speeds. This research considers the inherent interdependence
between traffic engineering and resource allocation in
improving network performance. We improved the initial
model of the k-mean clustering algorithm and combined it with
other ML network security algorithms like Qlearning/Reinforcement Learning to give our final proposed
KRL-RA model. We have further discussed various existing
models of intrusion detection, network security, and resource
allocation, and compared them to our improved version of the
proposed KRL-RA model, which uses Machine Learning to
improve its efficiency and reliability using past records. We
have shown that with two different practical cases. Through
iterative learning, the system obtains a better understanding of
the network environment, leading to a greater intrusion
detection success rate.
